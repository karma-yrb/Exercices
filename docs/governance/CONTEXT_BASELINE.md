# Context Baseline

Minimum context contract required by agents:

1. Learner profiles
- Strengths, weaknesses, interests, tone constraints.

2. Curriculum roadmap
- Sequence of notions and target level by profile.

3. Progress memory
- What has already been taught and validated.

4. Audit policy
- Severity model: Critique / Majeur / Mineur.
- Release gate: no open Critique.

Privacy split:
- Keep personal/family data local-only.
- Keep process and quality rules versioned in repository.
